Warning: the "docker" command appears to already exist on this system.

If you already have Docker installed, this script can cause trouble, which is
why we're displaying this warning and provide the opportunity to cancel the
installation.

If you installed the current Docker package using this script and are using it
again to update Docker, you can ignore this message, but be aware that the
script resets any custom changes in the deb and rpm repo configuration
files to match the parameters passed to the script.

You may press Ctrl+C now to abort this script.
